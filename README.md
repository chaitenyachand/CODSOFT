#CodSoft Data Science Internship Portfolio


Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio at CodSoft! This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

#Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Description: I created a system to predict movie ratings using Python. This involved collecting data, preparing it, and building a model to forecast movie ratings.

#Sales Prediction using Python
Description: I worked on predicting sales for a business. This project included preparing data, analyzing it, and creating a model to predict future sales.

#Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description: I developed a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This project involved handling imbalanced data, preprocessing information, and using logistic regression for classification

These projects showcase my abilities in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Each project folder contains detailed documentation and code files that explain the analysis, approach, and outcomes of the projects.
